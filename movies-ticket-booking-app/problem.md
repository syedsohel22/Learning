Creating a schema for a "Movie Ticket Booking App" with tables for users, tickets, theaters, shows, seats, and movies involves defining the structure of the database and the relationships between these entities. Below is a simplified schema for such an application:

1. **Users Table:**

   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `password`
   - Other user-related attributes (e.g., name, phone)

2. **Movies Table:**

   - `movie_id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `genre`
   - `release_date`
   - Other movie-related attributes

3. **Theaters Table:**

   - `theater_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `location`
   - Other theater-related attributes

4. **Shows Table:**

   - `show_id` (Primary Key)
   - `movie_id` (Foreign Key referencing Movies Table)
   - `theater_id` (Foreign Key referencing Theaters Table)
   - `start_time`
   - `end_time`
   - Other show-related attributes

5. **Seats Table:**

   - `seat_id` (Primary Key)
   - `theater_id` (Foreign Key referencing Theaters Table)
   - `seat_number`
   - Other seat-related attributes

6. **Tickets Table:**
   - `ticket_id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users Table)
   - `show_id` (Foreign Key referencing Shows Table)
   - `seat_id` (Foreign Key referencing Seats Table)
   - `purchase_date`
   - Other ticket-related attributes (e.g., price)

The relationships between these tables can be described as follows:

- Each user can have multiple tickets, so there is a one-to-many relationship between Users and Tickets (1 user to many tickets).
- Each movie can have multiple shows, so there is a one-to-many relationship between Movies and Shows (1 movie to many shows).
- Each theater can have multiple shows, so there is a one-to-many relationship between Theaters and Shows (1 theater to many shows).
- Each show can have multiple seats, so there is a one-to-many relationship between Shows and Seats (1 show to many seats).
- Each ticket is associated with one user, one show, and one seat, which creates three one-to-many relationships: Users to Tickets (1 user to many tickets), Shows to Tickets (1 show to many tickets), and Seats to Tickets (1 seat to many tickets).

This schema should provide a foundation for your "Movie Ticket Booking App" database.
