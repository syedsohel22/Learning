### Difference between `position: absolute` and `position: relative`

In CSS, `position: absolute` and `position: relative` are both positioning properties, but they behave differently.

- `position: relative`: This property allows you to position an element relative to its normal position. For example:

  ```css
  .relative-container {
    position: relative;
  }

  .absolute-child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
  }

  .container {
    position: relative;
  }
  ```

```css
.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
