# Python Data Types

In Python, data types are the classifications of data items. Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable; Python automatically assigns the data type based on the value. Here are some of the fundamental data types in Python:

## 1. Integers (`int`)

Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

```python
age = 25
temperature = -5
```
````

## 2. Floating-point numbers (`float`)

Floats are numbers with a decimal point or in exponential (scientific) notation.

```python
price = 19.99
gravitational_constant = 6.67430e-11
```

## 3. Strings (`str`)

Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
multiline_text = """This is a
multiline string."""
```

## 4. Booleans (`bool`)

Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`.

```python
is_student = True
has_passed = False
```

## 5. Lists (`list`)

Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. Lists are mutable.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## 6. Tuples (`tuple`)

Tuples are ordered collections of items similar to lists, but they are immutable.

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

## 7. Dictionaries (`dict`)

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values can be of any data type.

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
grades = {"math": 90, "science": 85, "history": 88}
```

## 8. Sets (`set`)

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}
```

These are some of the most common data types in Python. Each type serves different purposes and can be used depending on the requirements of the task.
